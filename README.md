r_aidmaster's Roleplay and Build Suite

NOTE: 1.x branch is officially out of full development, as efforts have shifted towards the much more advanced 2.x. There is very likely to be any new feature updates to 1.x.

raidRoleplay (now known as r_aidmaster's Roleplay and Build Suite) is an open-source UI and F3X modification framework that provides a multitude of features that range from essential to convenient for games that are based around building and/or roleplaying.

DEVELOPERS:
To work with the raidRoleplay source, either insert a fresh model into your game, or use the provided RemodelRBXMXToDirectory.lua file with the Remodel utility to create a directory to work in with a RBXMX file from Roblox Studio. You can also use the provided RemodelDirectoryToRBXMX.lua utility to convert your local directory to an RBXMX for usage.
