DEVELOPERS:
To work with the RBRS source, either insert a fresh model into your game, or use the provided RemodelRBXMXToDirectory.lua file with the Remodel utility to create a directory to work in with a RBXMX file from Roblox Studio. You can also use the provided RemodelDirectoryToRBXMX.lua utility to convert your local directory to an RBXMX for usage ingame and in Studio.

Remodel can be found at:
